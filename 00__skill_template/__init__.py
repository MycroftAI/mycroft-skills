# Each skill is contained within its own class, which inherits base methods
# from the MycroftSkill class.  You extend this class as shown below.

# TODO: Change "Template" to a unique name for your skill

    # The "handle_xxxx_intent" function is triggered by Mycroft when the
    # skill's intent is matched.  The intent is defined by the IntentBuilder()
    # pieces, and is triggered when the user's utterance matches the pattern
    # defined by the keywords.  In this case, the match occurs when one word
    # is found from each of the files:
    #    vocab/en-us/Hello.voc
    #    vocab/en-us/World.voc
    # In this example that means it would match on utterances like:
    #   'Hello world'
    #   'Howdy you great big world'
    #   'Greetings planet earth'

            self.count -= 1
        self.speak_dialog("count.is.now", data={"count": self.count})

    # The "stop" method defines what Mycroft does when told to stop during
    # the skill's execution. In this case, since the skill's functionality
    # is extremely simple, there is no need to override it.  If you DO
    # need to implement stop, you should return True to indicate you handled
    # it.

# Note that it's outside the class itself.

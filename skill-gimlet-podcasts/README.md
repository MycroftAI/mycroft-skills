# Gimlet Podcast Skill

This skill allows you to listen to podcasts from the Gimlet network

## Usage
* `play the latest episode of the startup podcast`

* `play an episode of the crimetown podcast`

## Current state

Working features:
 - Listen to the latest episode of your chosen podcast

Known issues:
 - Only tested on a Mark 1
 - Not sure how this skill co-operates with other podcast skills

TODO:
 - Select a recent podcast, not just the most recent one
 - I would ultimately like to build a skill that plays podcasts from a wide database, not just my hardcoded dictionary of rss_urls

    # skill's intent is matched.  The intent is defined by the IntentBuilder()
    # pieces, and is triggered when the user's utterance matches the pattern
    # defined by the keywords.  In this case, the match occurs when one word
    # is found from each of the files:
    #    vocab/en-us/Hello.voc
    #    vocab/en-us/World.voc
    # In this example that means it would match on utterances like:
    #   'Hello world'
    #   'Howdy you great big world'
    #   'Greetings planet earth'

## How to Add Skills to the Repo!

### Step 1 Make a Repo
If you want to submit a skill, simply make a repo for it organized   
as the template above. [How To Make a Repo](https://help.github.com/articles/create-a-repo/)

[Example Skill Template](https://github.com/MycroftAI/mycroft-skills/tree/master/00__skill_template)  

### Step 2 Clone Repo
Clone the mycroft-skills repo to a local directory, [How To Clone](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository) if you are unfamiliar with the process.

### Step 3 Generate Readme
To get the skill added, generate the Readme file using the [Meta Editor](http://rawgit.com/MycroftAI/mycroft-skills/master/meta_editor.html) You will fill out all the relative fields and it will give you the Markdown to put into your README.md file.

### Step 4 Add Submodule
Next we need to add the submodule for your skill. For more help, feel free to check out [this guide](https://github.com/blog/2104-working-with-submodules)

Or, type the following in the terminal of your clone of the Skills-repo.
```
git submodule add $remote $name-your-skill
```
Where $remote is the git address for your repo (example https://github.com/mycroftai/skill-configuration) and $name-your-skill is what you want to name it. In general, we normally use BLANK-skill as a format for skill names.

This should have edited the .gitmodule file and added something similar to the bottom of the file:
```
+[submodule "NAME OF YOUR SKILL"]
 +	path = name-of-your-skill-skill
 +	url = URL.FOR.YOUR.SKILL.git
```

### Step 5 Modify Skills Repo README.md
Modify the table section to include the direct link to your repo like the following example including the break tag and the phrase to trigger your skill:

```
| :heavy_check_mark:  | [home-assistant](https://github.com/btotharye/mycroft-homeassistant#readme)| Control your devices in home-assistant<br>```turn on office```

``````
Ensure to put a proper status as well from the list below:

**Status meaning:**  
:heavy_check_mark: good working order  
:construction:     still being developed and not ready for general use (for reference/collaboration)  
:question:         untested (by us)  
:skull:            Broken, but good for ideas!

### Step 6 Submit PR (Pull Request)
Once you've got your repo organized properly, submit the PR consisting of the following:
* Ensure you use [Meta Editor](http://rawgit.com/MycroftAI/mycroft-skills/master/meta_editor.html) to create your standardized README.md file
* The URL of your repo
* A short name for the skill
* A one sentence description of what it does
* The development status of the skill (under construction or working)  

### MSM Compliance
To make your skill capable of being installed via MSM (the Mycroft Skill Manager) you need two additional files.
* requirements.txt
* requirements.sh
requirements.txt is a list of all pip libraries your skill needs (if any).
requirements.sh is a shell script that executes and installs package dependancies  your skill needs (if any).
So, if you need a specific pip library installed, like gensim, you can have it automatically installed in the correct vm using msm.
This requirements.txt file would look like this:
```
gensim
```
That's it!  

**Status meaning:**  
:heavy_check_mark: good working order  
:construction:     still being developed and not ready for general use (for reference/collaboration)  
:question:         untested (by us)  
:skull:            Broken, but good for ideas!

## Community Contributed Skill List
**When submitting a skill make sure skill name links to the location of the skill, we are doing away with the wiki pages.  Also please include the phrase to trigger on as well for your skill.**
